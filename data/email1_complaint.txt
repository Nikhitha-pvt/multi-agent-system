Subject: Product Malfunction - Immediate Attention Required

Body:
Dear Customer Support,

I bought the XYZ gadget from your store last week, but now it is not working. I have tried the steps in the manual, but it still won't turn on. This is very frustrating.

Please let me know how I can return it or get a replacement.

Thank you,  
Jane Doe
